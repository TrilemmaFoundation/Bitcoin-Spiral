# Bitcoin-Spiral
A Python script to recreate the famous Bitcoin Spiral Chart in a Jupyter notebook. Plus a script for animating the visualization.

## Introduction
This is currently my favorite Bitcoin chart. 

Youâ€™ve probably seen this chart before, but use this repo as an opportunity to dive deeper and truly understand it.

- Learn more about this chart in this [Substack article](https://bitcoinstrategy.substack.com/p/bitcoin-spiral).
- Explore an interactive version via the Bitbo.io [dashboard](https://charts.bitbo.io/halving-spiral/).
- Watch this youtube video for an overview of the chart: [Cycle Analysis w/Rational Root - Bitcoin 2023](https://youtu.be/AsT55mpG_G0?si=GOVr_h4TSF5Aoi9l) 

This visualization is meant to serve as a baseline for you to expand upon. Think about the patterns and trends that emerge, like the fact that no crossings have taken place as of Sep 26, 2024, and what this property could imply for the future.
